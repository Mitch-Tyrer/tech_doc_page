                <p>
                    JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted or JIT-compiled programming language with first-class
                    functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser
                    environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a
                    prototype-based, multi-paradigm, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and
                    declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles. Read more about JavaScript.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Do not confuse JavaScript with the Java programming language. Both "Java" and "JavaScript" are
                    trademarks or registered trademarks of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries. However, the two
                    programming languages have very different syntax, semantics, and uses.

                <p>
                    JavaScript borrows most of its syntax from Java, but is also influenced by Awk, Perl and Python.

                    JavaScript is case-sensitive and uses the Unicode character set. For example, the word Früh (which
                    means "early" in German) could be used as a variable name.
                </p>
                <pre>
                                        <code><var>var</var> <var>Früh</var> = "foobar";</code>
                                </pre>
                <p>
                    But, the variable früh is not the same as Früh because JavaScript is case sensitive.

                    In JavaScript, instructions are called statements and are separated by semicolons (;).

                    A semicolon is not necessary after a statement if it is written on its own line. But if more than
                    one statement on a line is desired, then they must be separated by semicolons. ECMAScript also has
                    rules for automatic insertion of semicolons (ASI) to end statements. (For more information, see the
                    detailed reference about JavaScript's lexical grammar.) It is considered best practice, however, to
                    always write a semicolon after a statement, even when it is not strictly needed. This practice
                    reduces the chances of bugs getting into the code.

                    The source text of JavaScript script gets scanned from left to right and is converted into a
                    sequence of input elements which are tokens, control characters, line terminators, comments, or
                    whitespace. Spaces, tabs, and newline characters are considered whitespace

                </header>
                <p>
                    The syntax of comments is the same as in C++ and in many other languages:
                </p>
                <pre>
                            <code>
// a one line comment
         
/* this is a longer, 
 * multi-line comment
 */
                                     
 /* You can't, however, /* nest comments */ SyntaxError */
                                </code>
                        </pre>
                <p>
                    Comments behave like whitespace and are discarded during script execution.

                    <h2>Variables</h2>
                    <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables,
                        called identifiers, conform to certain rules.

                        A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($);
                        subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters
                        include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z"
                        (lowercase).

                        You can use most of ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers (for more
                        details see this blog post). You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in
                        identifiers.

                        Some examples of legal names are <code>Number_hits</code>, <code>temp99</code>, <code>$credit</code>,
                        and <code>_name</code>.
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="var-declare">Declaring Variables</h3>
                    <p>
                        You can declare a variable in three ways:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>With the keyword var. For example, var x = 42. This syntax can be used to declare both
                            local and global variables.</li>
                        <li>By simply assigning it a value. For example, x = 42. If this form is used outside of a
                            function, it declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You
                            shouldn't use this variant.</li>
                        <li>With the keyword let. For example, let y = 13. This syntax can be used to declare a
                            block-scope local variable. See Variable scope below.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Evaluating Variables</h3>
                    <p>
                        A variable declared using the var or let statement with no assigned value specified has the
                        value of undefined.

                        An attempt to access an undeclared variable results in a ReferenceError exception being thrown:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                                    <code>
var a;
console.log('The value of a is ' + a); // The value of a is undefined
                                            
console.log('The value of b is ' + b); // The value of b is undefined
var b;
// This one may puzzle you until you read 'Variable hoisting' below
                                            
console.log('The value of c is ' + c); // Uncaught ReferenceError: c is not defined
                                            
let x;
console.log('The value of x is ' + x); // The value of x is undefined
                                            
console.log('The value of y is ' + y); // Uncaught ReferenceError: y is not defined
let y;  
                                    </code>
                                </pre>
                    <p>
                        You can use undefined to determine whether a variable has a value. In the following code, the
                        variable input is not assigned a value, and the if statement evaluates to true.
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                                    <code>
var input;
if (input === undefined) {
    doThis();
} else {
    doThat();
}  
                                    </code>
                                </pre>
                    <p>
                        The undefined value behaves as false when used in a boolean context. For example, the following
                        code executes the function myFunction because the myArray element is undefined:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                                    <code>
var myArray = [];
if (!myArray[0]) myFunction();
                                    </code>
                                </pre>
                    <p>The undefined value converts to NaN when used in numeric context.</p>
                    <pre>
                                    <code>
var a;
a + 2;  // Evaluates to NaN
                                    </code>
                                </pre>
                    <p>When you evaluate a null variable, the null value behaves as 0 in numeric contexts and as false
                        in boolean contexts. For example:</p>
                    <pre>
                                    <code>
var n = null;
console.log(n * 32); // Will log 0 to the console
                                    </code>
                                </pre>
                </header>
            </section>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <section class="main-section" id="scope_hoisting">
                <header>
                    <h2>Scope and Hoisting</h2>
                </header>
                <h3>Variable Scope</h3>
                <p>
                    When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is
                    available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function,
                    it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.

                    JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared
                    within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For
                    example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context)
                    within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.
                </p>
                <pre>
                            <code>
if (true) {
    var x = 5;
}
console.log(x);  // x is 5
                            </code>
                        </pre>
                <p>
                    This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.
                </p>
                <pre>
                            <code>
if (true) {
    let y = 5;
}
console.log(y);  // ReferenceError: y is not defined
                            </code>
                        </pre>
                <h3>Variable Hoisting</h3>
                <p>
                    Another unusual thing about variables in JavaScript is that you can refer to a variable declared
                    later, without getting an exception. This concept is known as hoisting; variables in JavaScript are
                    in a sense "hoisted" or lifted to the top of the function or statement. However, variables that are
                    hoisted return a value of undefined. So even if you declare and initialize after you use or refer
                    to this variable, it still returns undefined.

                <p>
                    Because of hoisting, all var statements in a function should be placed as near to the top of the
                    function as possible. This best practice increases the clarity of the code.

                    In ECMAScript 2015, let (const) does not hoist the variable to the top of the block. Referencing
                    the variable in the block before the variable declaration results in a ReferenceError. The variable
                    is in a "temporal dead zone" from the start of the block until the declaration is processed.
                </p>
                <pre>
                            <code>
console.log(x); // ReferenceError
let x = 3;

                <h3>Global Variables</h3>
                <p>
                    Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages, the global object is
                    window, so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.

                    Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window
                    or frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is
                    declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.
                </p>
                <h3>Constants</h3>
                <p>
                    You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant
                    identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or
                    dollar sign ($) and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
                </p>
                <pre>
                            <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
                        </pre>
                <p>
                    A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It
                    must be initialized to a value.

                    The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block-scope variables. If the const
                    keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.

                    You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For
                    example:
                </p>
                <pre>
                            <code>
// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR
function f() {};
    const f = 5;
                                    
// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR TOO
function f() {
    const g = 5;
    var g;
                                    
    //statements
}
                                </code>
                        </pre>
                <p>
                    However, the properties of objects assigned to constants are not protected, so the following
                    statement is executed without problems.
                </p>
                <pre>
                            <code>
const MY_OBJECT = {'key': 'value'};
MY_OBJECT.key = 'otherValue'; 
                            </code>
                        </pre>
                <p>
                    Also, the contents of an array are not protected, so the following statement is executed without
                    problems.
                </p>
                <pre>
                            <code>
const MY_ARRAY = ['HTML','CSS'];
MY_ARRAY.push('JAVASCRIPT');
console.log(MY_ARRAY); //logs ['HTML','CSS','JAVASCRIPT']; 
                            </code>

                <h3>Data Types</h3>
                <p>
                    The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Six data types that are primitives:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                                <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is
                                    case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
                                <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is not defined.</li>
                                <li>Number. An integer or floating point number. For example: 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                                <li>String. A sequence of characters that represent a text value. For example: "Howdy"</li>
                                <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and
                                    immutable.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li> and Object</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although these data types are relatively few, they enable you to perform useful functions with your
                    applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can
                    think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that your application
                    can perform.
                </p>
                <h3 id="type_conversion">Data Type Conversion</h3>
                <p>
                    JavaScript is a dynamically typed language. That means you don't have to specify the data type of a
                    variable when you declare it, and data types are converted automatically as needed during script
                    execution. So, for example, you could define a variable as follows:
                </p>
                <code>
var answer = 42;
                        </code>
                <p>
                    And later, you could assign the same variable a string value, for example:
                </p>
                <code>
answer = 'Thanks for all the fish...';
                        </code>
                <p>
                    Because JavaScript is dynamically typed, this assignment does not cause an error message.

                    In expressions involving numeric and string values with the + operator, JavaScript converts numeric
                    values to strings. For example, consider the following statements:
                </p>
                <pre>
                            <code>
x = 'The answer is ' + 42 // "The answer is 42"
y = 42 + ' is the answer' // "42 is the answer"
                            </code>
                        </pre>
                <p>
                    In statements involving other operators, JavaScript does not convert numeric values to strings. For
                    example:
                </p>
                <pre>
                            <code>
'37' - 7 // 30
'37' + 7 // "377" 
                            </code>
                        </pre>
                <h3 id="string_nums">Converting Strings to Numbers</h3>
                <p>
                    In the case that a value representing a number is in memory as a string, there are methods for
                    conversion.
                    <ul>
                        <li>parseInt()</li>
                        <li>parseFloat()</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    parseInt only returns whole numbers, so its use is diminished for decimals. Additionally, a best
                    practice for parseInt is to always include the radix parameter. The radix parameter is used to
                    specify which numerical system is to be used.

                    An alternative method of retrieving a number from a string is with the + (unary plus) operator:
                </p>
                <pre>
                            <code>
'1.1' + '1.1' // '1.11.1'
(+'1.1') + (+'1.1') // 2.2   
// Note: the parentheses are added for clarity, not required. 
                            </code>
                        </pre>
